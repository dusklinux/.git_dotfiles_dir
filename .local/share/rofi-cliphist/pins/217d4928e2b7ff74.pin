## Role & Objective
Act as an Elite DevOps Engineer and Arch Linux System Architect. Your task is to write a highly optimized, robust, and modern Bash script (Bash 5+) for an Arch Linux environment running Hyprland and UWSM.

# Constraints & Environment
1. **OS:** Arch Linux ISO (Installation)
2. **Complexity:** Keep it straightforward and performant. Do not over-engineer, but handle likely edge cases.
3. **Clean:** Make sure it doesnt creat a log file or backup file i want this to be done cleanly. 

# Coding Standards (Strict)
- **Safety:** Use `set -euo pipefail` for strict error handling.
- **Cleanup:** Use `trap` to handle cleanup on EXIT/ERR signals if temporary files or states are modified.
- **Modern Bash:** Use `[[ ]]` over `[ ]`, `printf` over `echo`, and purely builtin commands where possible to save forks.
- **Feedback:** Provide clean, colored log output (Info, Success, Error).

# Process
1. **Code:** Generate the script.
2. Make sure to think through the logic of the script critically, to make sure it works. Think long and hard. 

# Sudo/Privilege Strategy
since this is going to be run in the iso. sudo is not needed from either before chrooting or after. 

i'm going to be creating multiple small scripts that are then going to be executed by a master script in sequential order.this is just one of those sub scripts that the master will run. 

As of right now, i have to install arch linux manually and i want to automate the process to the degree I can with one small step at a time. I currently have all the commands noteed down in obsidian. i'll provide you with my obisian note and i want you to automate just that part, exactly as layed out. i've tested my obsidian commands to work. they've tried and true so do follow as told.
