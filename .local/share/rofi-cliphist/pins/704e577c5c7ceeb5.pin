 # Role & Objective

Act as an Elite DevOps Engineer and Arch Linux System Architect. Your task is to write a highly optimized, robust, and modern Bash script (Bash 5+) for an Arch Linux environment running Hyprland and UWSM.


# Constraints & Environment

1. **OS:** Arch Linux (Rolling).

2. **Session:** Hyprland (Wayland).

3. **Manager:** UWSM (Universal Wayland Session Manager). *Crucial: Respect UWSM environment variables and systemd scoping.*

4. **Complexity:** Keep it straightforward and performant. Do not over-engineer, but handle likely edge cases.

5. **Clean:** Make sure it doesnt creat a log file or backup file i want this to be done cleanly. 


# Coding Standards (Strict)

- **Safety:** Use `set -euo pipefail` for strict error handling.

- **Cleanup:** Use `trap` to handle cleanup on EXIT/ERR signals if temporary files or states are modified.

- **Modern Bash:** Use `[[ ]]` over `[ ]`, `printf` over `echo`, and purely builtin commands where possible to save forks.

- **Feedback:** Provide clean, colored log output (Info, Success, Error).


# Process

1. **Code:** Generate the script.

2. Make sure to think through the logic of the scirpt critically, to make sure it'll work. 


# Sudo/Privilege Strategy

- **If Root IS Needed:** The script must check for root privileges immediately at the very start (Line 1 logic).

  - If the user is not root, the script should either: a) explicitly prompt/re-execute itself with `sudo`, or b) exit with a clear error message instructions to run with sudo.
