# ~/.config/psd/psd.conf

# 1. DISABLE OVERLAYFS (The "Max RAM" Switch)
# Default is "yes" (RAM saves changes only).
# Setting "no" forces a FULL COPY of the profile into RAM.
# With 64GB RAM, this is the single best setting for smoothness.
# It eliminates all read latency from your /mnt/browser partition.
USE_OVERLAYFS="no"

# 2. DEFINE BROWSER
# Explicitly tell it to look for Firefox.
# PSD follows symlinks, so it will seamlessly look through 
# ~/.mozilla -> /mnt/browser/.mozilla/firefox
BROWSERS=("firefox")

# 3. SYNC ON SUSPEND (Safety)
# Since your data is in RAM, if your PC sleeps and runs out of battery,
# you lose data. This forces a sync to disk right before the system sleeps.
USE_SUSPSYNC="yes"

# 4. CRASH RECOVERY
# Keep this ON. If your system crashes while the profile is in RAM,
# you need these backups to restore the state.
USE_BACKUPS="yes"
BACKUP_LIMIT=5
