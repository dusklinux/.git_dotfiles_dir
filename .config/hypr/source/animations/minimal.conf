    # Animation Rules
    # --------------------------------------------------------

    # Windows:
    # Open fast with a slight pop (popin 80% size) to minimize visual travel distance.
    # This feels faster than 'slide' for daily use.
    animation = windows, 1, 3, snap, popin 80%
    animation = windowsOut, 1, 3, snap, popin 80%
    animation = windowsMove, 1, 3, snap

    # Fade:
    # Very subtle. Just enough to smooth out the edges.
    animation = fade, 1, 2, pro
    
    # Border:
    # Immediate feedback when focus changes.
    animation = border, 1, 3, pro

    # Workspaces:
    # The crucial part. A fast slide that locks into place.
    # No 'slidevert' or fancy effects—just horizontal spatial context.
    animation = workspaces, 1, 3, pro, slide

    # Special Workspace (Scratchpad):
    # Differentiate it by sliding vertically.
    animation = specialWorkspace, 1, 3, pro, slidevert
