_systemd_ has its own logging system called the journal; running a separate logging daemon is not required. To read the log, use [journalctl(1)](https://man.archlinux.org/man/journalctl.1).

In Arch Linux, the directory `/var/log/journal/` is a part of the [systemd](https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=systemd) package, and the journal (when `Storage=` is set to `auto` in `/etc/systemd/journald.conf`) will write to `/var/log/journal/`. If that directory is deleted, _systemd_ will **not** recreate it automatically and instead will write its logs to `/run/log/journal/` in a non-persistent way. However, the directory will be recreated if `Storage=persistent` is added to `journald.conf` and `systemd-journald.service` is [restarted](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Restart "Restart") (or the system is rebooted).

Systemd journal classifies messages by [Priority level](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd/Journal#Priority_level) and [Facility](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd/Journal#Facility). Logging classification corresponds to classic [Syslog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog "wikipedia:Syslog") protocol ([RFC 5424](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424 "rfc:5424")).

## Priority level

A syslog severity code (in systemd called priority) is used to mark the importance of a message [RFC 5424 6.2.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424#section-6.2.1 "rfc:5424").

|Value|Severity|Keyword|Description|Examples|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|0|Emergency|emerg|System is unusable|Severe Kernel BUG, [systemd dumped core](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-coredump "Systemd-coredump").  <br>This level should not be used by applications.|
|1|Alert|alert|Should be corrected immediately|Vital subsystem goes out of work. Data loss.  <br>`kernel: BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffffc90403238ffc`.|
|2|Critical|crit|Critical conditions|Crashes, coredumps. Like familiar flash:  <br>`systemd-coredump[25319]: Process 25310 (plugin-containe) of user 1000 dumped core`  <br>Failure in the system primary application, like X11.|
|3|Error|err|Error conditions|Non-fatal error reported:  <br>`kernel: usb 1-3: 3:1: cannot get freq at ep 0x84`,  <br>`systemd[1]: Failed unmounting /var.`,  <br>`libvirtd[1720]: internal error: Failed to initialize a valid firewall backend`|
|4|Warning|warning|May indicate that an error will occur if action is not taken|A non-root file system has only 1GB free.  <br>`org.freedesktop. Notifications[1860]: (process:5999): Gtk-WARNING **: Locale not supported by C library. Using the fallback 'C' locale`|
|5|Notice|notice|Events that are unusual, but not error conditions|`systemd[1]: var.mount: Directory /var to mount over is not empty, mounting anyway`,  <br>`gcr-prompter[4997]: Gtk: GtkDialog mapped without a transient parent. This is discouraged`|
|6|Informational|info|Normal operational messages that require no action|`lvm[585]: 7 logical volume(s) in volume group "archvg" now active`|
|7|Debug|debug|Messages which may need to be enabled first, only useful for debugging|`kdeinit5[1900]: powerdevil: Scheduling inhibition from ":1.14" "firefox" with cookie 13 and reason "screen"`|

These rules are recommendations, and the priority level of a given error is at the application developer's discretion. It is always possible that the error will be at a higher or lower level than expected.

## Facility

A syslog facility code is used to specify the type of program that is logging the message [RFC 5424 6.2.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424#section-6.2.1 "rfc:5424").

|Facility code|Keyword|Description|Info|
|---|---|---|---|
|0|kern|Kernel messages|
|1|user|User-level messages|
|2|mail|Mail system|Archaic POSIX still supported and sometimes used (for more [mail(1)](https://man.archlinux.org/man/mail.1))|
|3|daemon|System daemons|All daemons, including systemd and its subsystems|
|4|auth|Security/authorization messages|Also watch for different facility 10|
|5|syslog|Messages generated internally by syslogd|For syslogd implementations (not used by systemd, see facility 3)|
|6|lpr|Line printer subsystem (archaic subsystem)|
|7|news|Network news subsystem (archaic subsystem)|
|8|uucp|UUCP subsystem (archaic subsystem)|
|9||Clock daemon|systemd-timesyncd|
|10|authpriv|Security/authorization messages|Also watch for different facility 4|
|11|ftp|FTP daemon|
|12|-|NTP subsystem|
|13|-|Log audit|
|14|-|Log alert|
|15|cron|Scheduling daemon|
|16|local0|Local use 0 (local0)|
|17|local1|Local use 1 (local1)|
|18|local2|Local use 2 (local2)|
|19|local3|Local use 3 (local3)|
|20|local4|Local use 4 (local4)|
|21|local5|Local use 5 (local5)|
|22|local6|Local use 6 (local6)|
|23|local7|Local use 7 (local7)|

Useful facilities to watch: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 15.

## Filtering output

_journalctl_ allows for the filtering of output by specific fields. If there are many messages to display, or if the filtering of large time spans has to be done, the output of this command can be extensively delayed.

Examples:

- Show all messages matching `_PATTERN_`:
    
    # journalctl --grep=_PATTERN_
    
- Show all messages from this boot:
    
    # journalctl -b
    
    However, often one is interested in messages not from the current, but from the previous boot (e.g. if an unrecoverable system crash happened). This is possible through optional offset parameter of the `-b` flag: `journalctl -b -0` shows messages from the current boot, `journalctl -b -1` from the previous boot, `journalctl -b -2` from the second previous and so on â€“ you can see the list of boots with their numbers by using `journalctl --list-boots`. See [journalctl(1)](https://man.archlinux.org/man/journalctl.1) for a full description; the semantics are more powerful than indicated here.
- Include explanations of log messages from the message catalog where available:
    
    # journalctl -x
    
    Note that this feature should not be used when attaching logs to bug reports and support threads, as to limit extraneous output. You can list all known catalog entries by running `journalctl --list-catalog`.
- Show all messages from date (and optional time):
    
    # journalctl --since="2012-10-30 18:17:16"
    
- Show all messages since 20 minutes ago:
    
    # journalctl --since "20 min ago"
    
- Follow new messages:
    
    # journalctl -f
    
- Show all messages by a specific executable:
    
    # journalctl /usr/lib/systemd/systemd
    
- Show all messages by a specific identifier:
    
    # journalctl -t sudo
    
- Show all messages by a specific process:
    
    # journalctl _PID=1
    
- Show all messages by a specific unit:
    
    # journalctl -u man-db.service
    
- Show all messages from user services by a specific unit:
    
    $ journalctl --user -u dbus
    
- Show kernel ring buffer:
    
    # journalctl -k
    
- Show only error, critical and alert priority messages:
    
    # journalctl -p err..alert
    
    You can use numeric log level too, like `journalctl -p 3..1`. If single number/log level is used, `journalctl -p 3`, then all higher priority log levels are also included (i.e. 0 to 3 in this case).
- Show auth.log equivalent by filtering on syslog facility:
    
    # journalctl SYSLOG_FACILITY=10
    
- If the journal directory (by default located under `/var/log/journal`) contains a large amount of log data then `journalctl` can take several minutes to filter output. It can be sped up significantly by using `--file` option to force `journalctl` to look only into most recent journal:
    
    # journalctl --file /var/log/journal/*/system.journal -f
    

See [journalctl(1)](https://man.archlinux.org/man/journalctl.1), [systemd.journal-fields(7)](https://man.archlinux.org/man/systemd.journal-fields.7), or [Lennart Poettering's blog post](http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/journalctl.html) for details.

**Tip**

- By default, _journalctl_ truncates lines longer than screen width, but in some cases, it may be better to enable wrapping instead of truncating. This can be controlled by the `SYSTEMD_LESS` [environment variable](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Environment_variable "Environment variable"), which contains options passed to [less](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Core_utilities#Essentials "Core utilities") (the default pager) and defaults to `FRSXMK` (see [less(1)](https://man.archlinux.org/man/less.1) and [journalctl(1)](https://man.archlinux.org/man/journalctl.1) for details).

By omitting the `S` option, the output will be wrapped instead of truncated. For example, start _journalctl_ as follows:

$ SYSTEMD_LESS=FRXMK journalctl

To set this behaviour as default, [export](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Environment_variables#Per_user "Environment variables") the variable from `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.

- While the journal is stored in a binary format, the content of stored messages is not modified. This means it is viewable with _strings_, for example for recovery in an environment which does not have _systemd_ installed, e.g.:
    
    $ strings /mnt/arch/var/log/journal/af4967d77fba44c6b093d0e9862f6ddd/system.journal | grep -i _message_
    

## Tips and tricks

### Journal size limit

If the journal is persistent (non-volatile), its size limit is set to a default value of 10% of the size of the underlying file system but capped at 4 GiB. For example, with `/var/log/journal/` located on a 20 GiB partition, journal data may take up to 2 GiB. On a 50 GiB partition, it would max at 4 GiB. To confirm current limits on your system review `systemd-journald` unit logs:

# journalctl -b -u systemd-journald

The maximum size of the persistent journal can be controlled by uncommenting and changing the following:

/etc/systemd/journald.conf

SystemMaxUse=50M

**Note** If `SystemMaxUse` is set to a large amount (for troubleshooting purposes, say), it may still be limited by the default `SystemKeepFree` parameter, which is set to 15 percent of the underlying filesystem. The journal daemon will respect both parameters, and use the smaller of the two.

It is also possible to use the [drop-in snippets](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Drop-in_snippet "Drop-in snippet") configuration override mechanism rather than editing the global configuration file. In this case, place the overrides under the `[Journal]` header:

/etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/00-journal-size.conf

[Journal]
SystemMaxUse=50M

[Restart](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Restart "Restart") the `systemd-journald.service` after changing this setting to apply the new limit.

See [journald.conf(5)](https://man.archlinux.org/man/journald.conf.5) for more info.

#### Per unit size limit by a journal namespace

[Edit](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Edit "Edit") the unit file for the service you wish to configure (for example sshd) and add `LogNamespace=ssh` in the `[Service]` section.

Then create `/etc/systemd/journald@ssh.conf` by copying `/etc/systemd/journald.conf`. After that, edit `journald@ssh.conf` and adjust `SystemMaxUse` to your liking.

[Restarting](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Restart "Restart") the service should automatically start the new journal service `systemd-journald@ssh.service`. The logs from the namespaced service can be viewed with `journalctl --namespace ssh`.

See [systemd-journald.service(8) Â§â€¯JOURNAL NAMESPACES](https://man.archlinux.org/man/systemd-journald.service.8#JOURNAL_NAMESPACES) for details about journal namespaces.

### Clean journal files manually

Journal files can be globally removed from `/var/log/journal/` using _e.g._ `rm`, or can be trimmed according to various criteria using `journalctl`. For example:

- Remove archived journal files until the disk space they use falls below 100M:
    
    # journalctl --vacuum-size=100M
    
- Make all journal files contain no data older than 2 weeks.
    
    # journalctl --vacuum-time=2weeks
    

Journal files must have been rotated out and made inactive before they can be trimmed by vacuum commands. Rotation of journal files can be done by running `journalctl --rotate`. The `--rotate` argument can also be provided alongside one or more vacuum criteria arguments to perform rotation and then trim files in a single command.

See [journalctl(1)](https://man.archlinux.org/man/journalctl.1) for more info.

### Journald in conjunction with syslog

Compatibility with a classic, non-journald aware [syslog](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Syslog-ng "Syslog-ng") implementation can be provided by letting _systemd_ forward all messages via the socket `/run/systemd/journal/syslog`. To make the syslog daemon work with the journal, it has to bind to this socket instead of `/dev/log` ([official announcement](https://lwn.net/Articles/474968/)).

The default `journald.conf` for forwarding to the socket is `ForwardToSyslog=no` to avoid system overhead, because [rsyslog](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Rsyslog "Rsyslog") or [syslog-ng](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Syslog-ng "Syslog-ng") pull the messages from the journal by [itself](https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/systemd-devel/2014-August/022295.html#journald).

See [Syslog-ng#Overview](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Syslog-ng#Overview "Syslog-ng") and [Syslog-ng#syslog-ng and systemd journal](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Syslog-ng#syslog-ng_and_systemd_journal "Syslog-ng"), or [rsyslog](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Rsyslog "Rsyslog") respectively, for details on configuration.

### Forward journald to /dev/tty12

Create a [drop-in directory](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd#Editing_provided_units "Systemd") `/etc/systemd/journald.conf.d` and create a `fw-tty12.conf` file in it:

/etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/fw-tty12.conf

[Journal]
ForwardToConsole=yes
TTYPath=/dev/tty12

Then [restart](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Restart "Restart") `systemd-journald.service`.

**Note** [By design](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/5129), this does not forward kernel ring log messages.

### Specify a different journal to view

There may be a need to check the logs of another system that is dead in the water, like booting from a live system to recover a production system. In such case, one can mount the disk in e.g. `/mnt`, and specify the journal path via `-D`/`--directory`, like so:

# journalctl -D /mnt/var/log/journal -e

### Journal access as user

By default, a regular user only has access to their own per-user journal. To grant read access for the system journal as a regular user, you can add that user to the `systemd-journal` [user group](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/User_group "User group"). Members of the `adm` and `wheel` groups are also given read access.

See [journalctl(1) Â§â€¯DESCRIPTION](https://man.archlinux.org/man/journalctl.1#DESCRIPTION) and [Users and groups#User groups](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Users_and_groups#User_groups "Users and groups") for more information.

### Desktop notifications

Desktop notifications can help you quickly notice error messages, improving awareness compared to manually checking logs or not noticing them at all.

The [journalctl-desktop-notification](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/journalctl-desktop-notification/)AUR package provides an automatic desktop notification for each error message logged by any process. For more details and configuration options, visit the [GitLab project page](https://gitlab.com/Zesko/journalctl-desktop-notification).
