just download an icon pack and then go to nwg-look's cursor tab to set it. or set it using the hyprctl cursor commadn followed by the size of the cursor you want. 

eg for bibata-modern-classic with 18 cursor size. (change the size to your liking)

```bash 
hyprctl setcursor Bibata-Modern-Classic 18
```

place icons and themes directory at this path. 
```bash
cd /usr/share/icons/
```
