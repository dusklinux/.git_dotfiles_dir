11. copy the gtk theme directory into the gtk directory of the theme directory. 
	- Make sure the color you set is the same for both the light and dark version of the css file, ie if you configured the hex code of the dark css file. copy it's entire contents to the other css file, do this for both gtk 3 and gtk 4. this is so that no mater which shade is in effect, it'll always have the same theme, becuase switching between light and dark mode doesn't work with a command through the script so if both files are teh same, selecing the shade is irrelevent
	- make sure to mention with just one word, "dark" or "light" (without quotes) reflecting the overall theme shade of the gtk theme in the gtk_theme_shade/shade.txt file. 
12. copy the Kvantum theme directory into the kvantum directory. this is for qt themeing.
