# master script

i want a master script for toggling between all availabe themes in this path. they are all directories and within it are individual configuration files for each app. 
```bash
$HOME/.config/theming/all_themes/
```
i want you to use the gum (bash scripting tool) to list the options to make it look pretty, and when an option is choosen i want you to delete exitsting file at  and create a new text file named user_set_theme.txt and place in it just the name of the theme the user picks from the list. nothing else. just the file, no extra spaces, no quotes, not anything else, just the name of the theme verbatum
```bash
$HOME/.config/theming/user_set_theme.txt
```

this text file will be referenced by other scripts toggle the theme for each app. 
i already have 15 individual scrpts for just that. i want this script to all other scripts, allow the user to point to each script up top in the script and then run each script one by one in sequential order, the sequence is important, the user will place it in the appropriate sequence. 

if you can think of other things to intorduce in the script, feel free to do that, make this script robust but don't create any extra files like backups or logging. i want it clean. this iwll be run using a keybind on arch linux, running hyprland. 
think long and hard , this is incredibly consequential so make sure to get this right

# generic prompt for llm
I'll be giving you a detailed list of things that are needed to be done to have this work. 
btw i'll be triggering the script with a key bind and it should automatically open the terminal. and give me the list of themes available in the all_themes directory. and with the gum toolkit, make it look pretty. 

I want you to create this script for changing gtk theme on my arch linux. make sure it's robust and comprehensive, and make sure it's silent because this script is going to be one of many scripts that will be run in sequence by one master script to change the over all system theme, this is just the GTK part. Think long and hard to make this script it's incredibly consequential. so don't fuck up or there will be grave consequences 

# GTK

this script is going to be one of many scripts that will be run in sequence by one master script to change the over all system theme, this is just the GTK part. 
for the myTheme place holder directory make sure to look for the current set theme by the user in this path , there will on be just the name of the directory and nothing else another. replace myTheme with the directory name from the text file obviously. 
```bash
$HOME/.config/theming/user_set_theme.txt
```


for gtk switching, i will first need you to check what the gtk theme is called because it's usually named something other than the name i have my theme eg. my theme might be called oragne but the gtk theme for this theme is called Orchis-Orange-compact something something , and i don't want to have to manually specify what each gtk theme is called for each theme, instead i have a certain structure to my directories that should allow you to automatically pick the theme in that directory and set that as the gtk theme, so here's where the gtk theme folder is placed within the theming directory hierarchy, like i previously said all my themes are in  $HOME/.config/theming/all_themes/ so with myTheme being the placeholder for the overall theme, i want you to look for the gtk folder in  $HOME/.config/theming/all_themes/myTheme/gtk and run the command, replace myTheme with the directory name from the text file obviously. 



myTheme is obviously the theme i choose. from the list. of available themes when i trigger the script. 

also in the gtk directory will be just one directory and that's the actual directory with the proper name and files. for the gtk theme to work,so just symlinking it will be sufficient. and the name of that directory should be used for the gsettings command later. 
myTheme is the place holder for the actual theme directory.
```bash
ln -nfs $HOME/.config/theming/all_themes/myTheme/gtk/* $HOME/.local/share/themes/
```


The symlinked_gtk_theme is a place holder for the actual name of the gtk theme obviously, what ever you find in the gtk folder, take it's name verbatum and swap it out with "symlinked_gtk_theme" 
```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme "symlinked_gtk_theme"
```

then this for libadwaita apps to also respect the gtk theme. create another symlink. 
agian, symlinked_gtk_theme is a place holder for the actual name of the gtk theme obviously, what ever is the name of the directory in gtk folder
```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.config/gtk-4.0 && ln -nfs $HOME/.local/share/themes/symlinked_gtk_theme/gtk-4.0/* $HOME/.config/gtk-4.0/
```

# QT
I want you to create this script for changing gtk theme on my arch linux. make sure it's robust and comprehensive, and make sure it's silent because this script is going to be one of many scripts that will be run in sequence by one master script to change the over all system theme, this is just the qt part. Think long and hard to make this script it's incredibly consequential. so don't fuck up or there will be grave consequences 

for the myTheme place holder directory make sure to look for the current set theme by the user in this path , there will on be just the name of the directory and nothing else another. replace myTheme with the directory name from the text file obviously. 
```bash
$HOME/.config/theming/user_set_theme.txt
```

all kvantum directories are uppcercase K 
then for qt apps. the qt theme name will differ from the user defined theme name for the entire theme. so with that in mind. 
the directory for kvantum themes is 
myTheme is the placeholder, replace myTheme with the directory name from the text file obviously. 
K for the kvantum directory is capital btw and theme_name is the place holder for the actual kavantum theme directory.  
```bash
$HOME/.config/theming/all_themes/myTheme/Kvantum/theme_name
```

the script will have to symlink the qt kvantum theme to the kavantum directory in .config with the following command 
theme_name is the place holder for the actual theme directory.  
```bash
ln -nfs $HOME/.config/theming/all_themes/myTheme/Kvantum/theme_name $HOME/.config/Kvantum/
```

then the script will need to also overwrite the kvantum.kvconfig file to update the name of the theme to reflect the name of the symlinked qt/kvantum theme. 
theme_name is the place holder for the actual kavantum theme directory name.  
```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.config/Kvantum" \
  && printf '%s\n' '[General]' 'theme=theme_name' > "$HOME/.config/Kvantum/kvantum.kvconfig"
```


# Color files
I want you to create this script for changing theme on my arch linux. make sure it's robust and comprehensive, and make sure it's silent because this script is going to be one of many scripts that will be run in sequence by one master script to change the over all system theme, this is just the colors files part. Think long and hard to make this script it's incredibly consequential. so don't fuck up or there will be grave consequences 

for the myTheme place holder directory make sure to look for the current set theme by the user in this path , there will on be just the name of the directory and nothing else another. replace myTheme with the directory name from the text file obviously. 


```bash
$HOME/.config/theming/user_set_theme.txt
```

i want the script to symlink all the files and not directories from inside the selected theme's directory. i only want the files to be symlinked and not the directories. because directories contain gtk theme and kvantum contains kvantum theme and the wallpaper contains the wallpaper for the theme, i'll potentially be adding more directories here or removing others if i change an app i use, or install a new one later so i want the script to be intelligent about it.

files_only is a place holder for all files. you write it in a way that makes sense. this is an example. 
```bash
ln -nfs $HOME/.config/theming/all_themes/myTheme/files_only $HOME/.config/theming/current/
```

# commands

I want you to create this script for changing theme on my arch linux. make sure it's robust and comprehensive, and make sure it's silent because this script is going to be one of many scripts that will be run in sequence by one master script to change the over all system theme, this is just reloading apps and stuff, i might add more apps to be reloaded in teh future or just some commands in general, so make it so that the script is easily editable by the user up top to enter in more commands. . Think long and hard to make this script, it's incredibly consequential. so don't fuck up or there will be grave consequences 

for the myTheme place holder directory make sure to look for the current set theme by the user in this path , there will on be just the name of the directory and nothing else another. replace myTheme with the directory name from the text file obviously. 


```bash
$HOME/.config/theming/user_set_theme.txt
```

now that the color files have been symlinked into the current folder for the config files of apps to source from,  i want the script to run these command, 

```bash
# for swaync
systemctl --user restart swaync.service 

# for waybar
killall waybar && waybar

# refresh hyprland
hyprctl reload

```

make sure the way bar is still active after the script end. like i dont' want the waybar to be killed when teh script ends also i dont want the script to get stuck it should proceed after each command . think in credibily long and hard. also i don't want any loogging or additional files created, i want it to be clean

# Wallpaper update

I want you to create this script for changing theme on my arch linux. make sure it's robust and comprehensive, and make sure it's silent because this script is going to be one of many scripts that will be run in sequence by one master script to change the over all system theme, this is just to update the wallpaper,I might have more than one image in the wallpaper directry for each theme directory so make sure to pick one wallpaer at random to keep it fresh everytime i switch themes. 

. . Think long and hard to make this script, it's incredibly consequential. so don't fuck up or there will be grave consequences 

for the myTheme place holder directory make sure to look for the current set theme by the user in this path , there will on be just the name of the directory and nothing else another. replace myTheme with the directory name from the text file obviously. 


```bash
$HOME/.config/theming/user_set_theme.txt
```

wallaper changing using (There might be more than one wallpaper in each directroy for wallpaper for every theme so pick one at random to keep it fresh, if there is only one wallpaper, then just apply that wallpaepr) replace myTheme with the actual theme name 

```bash
swww img $HOME/.config/theming/all_themes/myTheme/wallpaper/* --transition-type grow --transition-duration 2 --transition-fps 60
```

# Obsidian

I want you to create this script for changing theme on my arch linux, obsidian. make sure it's robust and comprehensive, and make sure it's silent because this script is going to be one of many scripts that will run in sequence by one master script to change the over all system theme, this is just the obsidian script. Think long and hard to make this script, it's incredibly consequential. so don't fuck up or there will be grave consequences 

for the myTheme place holder directory make sure to look for the current set theme by the user in this path , there will on be just the name of the directory and nothing else another. replace myTheme with the directory name from the text file obviously. 


```bash
$HOME/.config/theming/user_set_theme.txt
```


first symlink the theme directory within the folder named theme_folder to the theme directory within obsidian.  btw, this path for obsidian should be set as a user defined variable up top of the script to allow for changing the path later on if the user decides. 
and obvioulsy myTheme needs to be replaced by the text from the text file
```bash
ln -nfs $HOME/.config/theming/all_themes/myTheme/obsidian/theme_folder/* $HOME/Documents/pensive/.obsidian/themes/
```

then symlink the appearance file to obsidian's main directory. 
```bash
ln -nfs $HOME/.config/theming/all_themes/myTheme/obsidian/appearance.json $HOME/Documents/pensive/.obsidian/
```

# keyboard
now, i have a script to change the color of my asus tuf keyboard to run. that script is already made and is at the specified directory, if there are more scripts later that i want to have run, this is where you should run them, run them in order. 

```bash
$HOME/user_scripts/asus/asus_keyboard.sh
```

# NeoVim
I want you to create this script for changing theme on my arch linux, nvim, . make sure it's robust and comprehensive, and make sure it's silent because this script is going to be one of many scripts that will run in sequence by one master script to change the over all system theme, this is just the nvim script. Think long and hard to make this script, it's incredibly consequential. so don't fuck up or there will be grave consequences 

for the myTheme place holder directory make sure to look for the current set theme by the user in this path , there will on be just the name of the directory and nothing else another. replace myTheme with the directory name from the text file obviously. 


```bash
$HOME/.config/theming/user_set_theme.txt
```



this is to surgically edit the lua file for nvim.
first look for the line with theme = in the nvim.txt file in , replace myTheme with the actual theme name from teh text file. 

```bash
$HOME/.config/theming/all_themes/myTheme/nvim.txt
```
then, for eg if that line is 	theme = "dark-brown",
do something like this. to surgically edit the lua file for nvim. 
write the command to be robust to handle different amounts of white space, but it's good to define the fallback behavior so if there's an error, mention that and proceed forward without failing the entire script. 

this file needs to be edited, but just the line with `theme = "theme name"`  in it. 
$HOME/.config/nvim/lua/chadrc.lua


make the script robust, by making sure it addresses edge cases, and is future proof
